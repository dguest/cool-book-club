    <h1>Welcome to Dan's Homepage!!!'</h1>
    <p>I read a book about people living in <abbr title="like outer space!">space</abbr>. It's a few hundred years in the future. I think was believable.
      One of the main charicters thought giving everyone more information would make the world (well a few worlds) a better place.
      It was supposed to address a contemporary idea.
    </p>
    <p>I read another 9/5ths book about the same people. I never read Harry Potter but I imagine this is like that with slightly more violence, nonzero sex, and swearing. Also with spaceships. Were there religious people in Harry Potter?</p>
    <p>I finished "Bullshit Jobs", by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber">David Graeber</a>, which is only slightly more stepped in reality than the books about people fighting aliens around Neptune. Given the provocative title, you might expect the book to play out in one of two ways. Either:
      <ol>
        <li>The book attacks the livelihoods of many people, accusing them of toiling in "bullshit" as their life's work, where "bullshit" is subjectively defined by the author (see any book from any TV political pundit), or</li>
        <li>The book attacks the livelihoods of many people, accusing them of toiling in "bullshit", as defined by some sound economic definition (see Freakonomics, The Economist).
      </ol>
      But, as it turns out, the author is an anthropologist: he has no interest in economics, and spends less time on political punditry and more time rehashing tales of bullshit from interviews and letters. By focusing on self-reported bullshit jobs, the argument goes, he avoids leaning on any subjective definitions. And by avoiding economic arguments, he avoids the Primary Evil of the modern society ruled by the "managerial class", namely the fallacy that the value of people's time and labor can be commodified.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it turns out, quite a few people think their jobs are bullshit. And as an anthropologist, Graeber can make a fairly convincing case that This Is Not Normal. The whole institution of an hourly wage, he argues, is a bit of a historical aberration: historically people did not work because someone had bought their time. He goes on to argue that wage labor is both intrinsically unrewarding and socially degrading, even while society extols Hard Work as the greatest of virtues. The whole institution is one part conspiracy by the managerial class and one part the collective stupidity of a society that has failed to recognize the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth in Graeber's arguments should be obvious to anyone who has been awake the last 15 years. We learned this all from the internet: people click buttons if it makes their score go up, especially if it gives them perks. If our brightest minds in silicon valley have proven anything, it's that the human mind, properly dissected, has infinite potential for distraction toward tasks completely orthogonal to, if not detrimental to, our economic well-being. And if we don't work because people pay us, any economic system predicated on that assumption is at least on shaky foundations, if not complete garbage from bottom to top.
    </p>
    <p>I also sometimes read articles. Here are some good ones:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/humanitys-high-hopes-for-our-robotic-offspring">Humanity's High Hopes for Our Robotic Offspring</a>: Slightly cynical take on the future of technology and what current technology has taught us about humanity. From 2010, but still relevant today.</li>
        <li>I read a really good one about why South Africa is a mess now (hint, it's the British again). I think it was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/25/the-reputation-laundering-firm-that-ruined-its-own-reputation">in the New Yorker</a>, but I could be wrong (it's behind a paywall, have to double-check when I get around it</li>
        <li><a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/robot_armies.htm">Who will command the robot armies</a>: is actually a talk, generally about robots but touches on the idea that capitalism as a whole is far dumber than any one of its individual parts, and how robots in such a system are a fancy means toward incredibly stupid ends.</a>
